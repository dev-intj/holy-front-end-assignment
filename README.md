In this README file, you'll find all the necessary information you need about our small exercise.

First and foremost, let's take a look at the design. You'll find the Figma Mockup file at [this link.](https://www.figma.com/file/StoYUrxW8Lx5EUlwV1St9w/LiveInGreece?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=Z8xiqBBpO08TaZwN-0)

It's a small part of a complete landing page for one of our clients. This exercise will help you get a better insight of our design approach and it will also help us get a better understanding of your coding skill.

Exercise Requirements:
- Implement a custom cursor that interacts with specific elements, such as links and decorative elements, on the page.
- Create a navigation header that remains fixed at the top and follows the page as it's scrolled.
- Create the intro section to include the following interactions:
    - When the dot cursor hovers over a circle containing an image, the circle changes its color. Simultaneously, another dot should expand to cover the hovered circle, revealing an accompanying arrow.
    - BONUS: Ensure that the arrow's tip consistently points back at the dot cursor's position.
- Create the links section with the following interactions:
    - Upon hovering the dot cursor over a link, both the link's color and the cursor's color should change.
    - Additionally, a box beneath the link's title should expand, covering the title.

Feel free to explore these creative interactions to enhance the exercise. Your implementation of the bonus component will be greatly appreciated.
The mobile version of this exercise has been intentionally omitted, and we are entrusting that aspect to your discretion.
Regarding the choice of tech stack, please feel free to utilize whichever tools you are most at ease with.
The focus will be placed on the quality of the code.
